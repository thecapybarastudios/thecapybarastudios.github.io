About Me
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
I'm a small time game developer who makes games and doesnt really expect much from them. <br>
I would put my games on steam butthey make you pay $100 to publish one. <br>
I do hope to get money from these games but i dont expect to. <br>
You should get the games on this website from the scource, itch.io,<br>
you can support me there by donating and you can also play the full games.<br>
(these are erly versions to keep the loading time down)<br>
